# pageRank
This repository includes a basic implementation of the pagerank algorithm of which Google built their initial search engine. Does not include anything regarding to NLP (natural language processing) but does have the capacity to rank pages based off of their relative importance (number of times referenced) to other pages. This was the initial underlying data structure of Google's initial search engine and has been built off of and developed since their founding.
